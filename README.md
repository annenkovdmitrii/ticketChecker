# Description

This script checks the Chase Lounge page for available Rangers game tickets every 5 minutes. If it finds any, it sends an email notification to the specified recipient.

Please note that you'll need to replace the placeholders in the script with your email credentials and the recipient's email address. Additionally, you might need to enable "Less secure apps" in your email account settings to use the script. Be aware that doing so might reduce the security of your email account. You may also want to consider using an application-specific password or a different email service that supports more secure authentication methods.
